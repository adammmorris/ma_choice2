However, I believe that I stated in a terrible manner earlier that the quality of the kitchen was the top priority.

The user picked two key points that they were going to evaluate the homes on, the kitchen and the A/C. The quality of the kitchen weighed more than the quality of the A/C. However, if the difference in the quality of the kitchen was somewhat minor, the user would then make their choice based on the quality of the A/C. However, sometimes it felt that the user was a bit inconsistent in their strategy. My best guess is that the kitchen was the most important factor in determining which home they chose followed by the A/C.","I paid attention to the trials looking for some kind of pattern. Initially I thought it had to do something with the noise level but a couple of trials went by and threw that theory out the window. Eventually I began to notice that the user began to chose the home with the better kitchen. So I was beginning to predict a lot more of their choices correctly. However, if the kitchens weren't too far apart, the user used their second evaluator, the quality of the A/C to determine their decision. For a majority of the trials by using these two factors, the kitchen and the A/C I was able to correctly predict most of the user's choices.
