I would rather watch a really bad movie with a good soundtrack than a mediocre movie with a bad sountrack. If the decision was between a mostly bad movie and a really bad movie I chose the really bad movie because sometimes they are more fun/memorable than just a mediocre one you will forget about instantly. If they were almost the same sometimes I chose based on which had the better acting or humor. If one movie had mostly good ratings in all categories and one had mostly bad, I chose the mostly good one. I also decided to assume that the ratings matched with my personal feelings of good and bad because it was way too complicated to assume they would be meaningless to me because they were based on someone else's standards of good and bad. ","No, I would not say it has changed but you may have worded some of it a little better. Frequently soundtrack was the deciding factor between movies that didn't have amazing scores in several other categories. If a movie was mostly bad or mediocre I chose the extra bad one because I thought it might be more entertaining. If they were kind of the equally good or bad and soundtracks were similar I chose the one that had a good humor or acting score. It really depended on the whole list of things- sometimes many categories were important but not equally and only if they were wildly different from one another. I wouldn't just pick bad over really bad. it needed to be really good over bad or moderate to make a big difference in my scoring. If a movie scored pretty high in many categories and it's counterpart scored very low I would pick the high scoring one. If a movie scored middle of the road to low in many categories and it's counterpart scored very low I picked the very low one. "," I know my choice process because I thought about it like you asked at the beginning of the study.

The acting was also an issue but not as much as having good dialogue because I am accustomed to listening to the radio. I have no interest in romantic scenes and so they also were a factor but in all of the choices my decision was affected by dialogue and acting. I noticed the options in the boxes moved around and so I also had to read them carefully to make certain the movie would contain those two features or the best choice of those two features. Since I spend more time listening as opposed to watching images on a screen, the visuals or action scenes were not as important. I also hoped that the movie with the better dialogue and acting would not have so many romantic or action scenes. Since there was no way to know what the movie might be, I figured if I stuck with the two options that were most important to me, perhaps the algorithm that might be used to calculate my interests would notice my preference for these two options. I think one time the choices were given and there were only those two on one movie without all of the other selections. So I felt the options given were perhaps controlled by something that could detect what selections I kept making since the other values were not so important to me.",I don't think my description has changed in the sense that I focused on dialogue as most important followed by acting. But dialogue was always the main target through all of the selections offered. I think the questions in this last section offered a label of different strategies but I did stick to only one strategy all the way through section 1.,"According to the strategies offered, I would say I fell into the categories of A and C for the most part because I was primarily focused on dialogue above all else. But I considered acting as a second choice when there were times dialogue was not included and acting was given a rating. I know what my section 1 choice process was because I only was concerned about the dialogue being good and little else. I answered those questions in section 2 by looking at how I had chosen between the two options and the knowledge that I had only one main focus.

If so, I usually went with that one. But when looking at individual pieces - acting was a top spot for me, followed by humor, action, dialogue and plot. I really don't care so much about things like creativity or visuals or soundtrack and especially don't care about romance scenes. Not that I don't appreciate them if they are good, just not factors that will outweigh bad ratings on my top areas. Usually, bad/really bad acting is an issue for me. So unless there were high marks for all of my other priorities, acting was mainly a heavy factor in choosing. But moderate acting would win above very good acting if the ratings for humor and/or action were better. I've enjoyed movies with terrible plots because they were just fun to watch, were funny and/or had good action scenes. I've watched 'bad' acting in a handful of movies that were still fun to watch and enjoyed them because of the above. It's also hard to know what whoever made these ratings based it off of.
