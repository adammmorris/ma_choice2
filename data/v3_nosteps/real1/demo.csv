Some of the decisions were quite tough and made me choose between things that were really important to me. However, if one of my most important factors wasn't met, it wasn't an immediate dealbreaker, if everything else on the list was really good I realized I could make compromises such as going out of the home to do laundry even though I'd really prefer not to,  if it meant a bigger yard, more stability in the quality of our home, or better schools for our kid.","I did a lot of reflection I guess, I picked up pretty quickly through section one on what factors were the most important to me and why, so answering section two felt easy for me.
