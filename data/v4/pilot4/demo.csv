That's because I have lived without these features, or severely compromised versions of them, and let me tell you -- you need a working kitchen! Trying to run everything off, say, a hot plate is a miserable exercise. Working with a microwave is a little better, judging by the number of microwave cookbooks, but without a stove that's operating, in good condition, it's still a miserable affair.

Same goes for A/C -- if you live in a really hot area, you'll sweat your you-know-what-off, and it'll be hard to sleep, or do anything else. It eventually escalates to the point where you spend as little time as possible at home, and you find excuses ('reasons') to avoid spending much time there, other than to put your head down (maybe).

You'll typically find these features (or lack thereof) in poorer neighborhoods. Things are better for me now, but these are examples of how going without something can make your life a lot tougher than it should be otherwise.

Because of that Section 2 started off easy, but it got progressively more confusing because you considered many more details than I did. You're the researchers, you're studying how people make decisions, so I accept you'd want details. But the way you structured it made the second section actually harder for me to do than the first. The question that was the hardest for me was what other people should do when they're making decisions. There is no way for me to answer that; what people should do depends on how they make decisions and I would not presume to tell anyone to do it my way, because what I do may not work at all for someone else.

Those decisions were made very quickly, because to me when both homes are the same cost, what you are getting for the cost matters. To me, the year the home was built is most important, followed by the size of the home. I noticed some patterns when the choice was not that easy. When there was no yard at all, it was often a deal breaker, but sometimes if parks were closeby, it didn't matter. I also looked at kitchen quality and AC/heat quality as complimentary/opposing values, as they would both cost similar amounts to completely upgrade if the quality was Very Bad or Bad. I noticed also if there was a large yard it wasn't a big concern to me, because often the value for noise pollution was high enough that it made me think sitting in the yard would not be that enjoyable anyway. So in short my process was to find the house with the newer build year, and from that point, try to qualify or disqualify it. No yard or very small house size would often disqualify it.

The size of the house was the most second important feature especially when there was a considerable difference in the size of the houses.

I cared somewhat about the kitchen as I like to cook but it was not a deal breaker as a kitchen can be renovated.

I did not care about the nearby school as I have no children.
The year of the house was not important as I'd rather live in an older house with a yard than a newer house with little to no yard.","I answered the questions in section 2 based on the decisions I made in section 1.
My section 1 process was choosing mainly the yard and house size. 
While the condition of the kitchen mattered a little, it was not a major factor.
The condition of the AC/heating was not a major deal as that can be replaced. 
I rarely go to parks as a lot of illegal activity tends to occur at many parks.
I did not want one too close to me but also not super far if I did choose to go occasionally.
As for noise pollution as long as a room or two could be soundproof that would not be a deal breaker as well.
I would have planned on working from home so traffic would not be a major factor either.
