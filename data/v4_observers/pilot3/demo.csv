I struggle to recall them ever choosing a house where that wasn't at least moderate. Other than that, though, they didn't really seem to have any big sticking points. There were several instances where they accepted the worst end of all the other features. I can only assume that their thought process, after ensuring the AC and heat are decent, was to just weigh the advantages of each house against each other and go with whatever has the most. That said, there were also some features that they didn't seem to really value at all, namely the quality of schools, distance from parks, and yard size (or even having a yard at all). ","I would maybe phrase it differently given all the info about the different strategies I've read and all the further reflection on their choices, but none of the substance behind the description would really change. I think the best descriptor of their strategy wasn't one that the study really captured though, which is sort of a blend of a few different strategies -- a pretty narrow focus on one feature of the house, but broadening out later once that one feature has met a certain standard. For example, a home with moderate AC/heat would be picked over a home with bad AC/heat every time, but a home with very good AC/heat may or may not be picked over a home with moderate AC/heat. In decisions where both homes had at least moderate AC/heat, the other features would be weighed a lot more.","By examining the selections they made and searching for patterns. The most obvious was that they hated the idea of a house with bad AC/heating. This simultaneously made it easier and harder to figure out the rest of their preferences going forward. If a house with bad AC/heating was being compared to a house where it's good, then their wasn't going to be any other useful info to come from the choice, so I could pretty much only learn about their choice process when both houses had decent AC/heat. I did eventually pick up on some of their other trends though. Home size and noise pollution seemed to be the most likely deciders after AC/heat, with none of the other features having much impact on their decisions, and with schools, parks and yards having basically no impact at all.
