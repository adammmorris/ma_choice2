Another confusing point was that if the other people at the event were people I was more familiar with vs them being strangers, decisions could have been slightly adjusted. Generally though, if there was alcohol without food, that was not the greatest sign. I enjoy alcohol, so that was a plus. Distance didn't matter much to me because I used to travel quite a bit, so that wasn't much of a factor much of the time. If an event had physical exercise, then I would be more apt to pick it. I like socializing as well, especially at events, because that's what events are for, so if a choice did not have any socializing, that was a negative factor. ","I think my strategy was all over the place now that I am looking at it more critically. If all things were equal, it would be easier to make a decision between two events, but since they were not, factoring in how much something matter was very hard. For example, I don't mind music, but I don't particularly care for it at events. That being said, if socialization was high, I may not want much music, since music may get in the way of socialization. But with a lot of physical exercise, music can be a great option. Therefore, I would describe my strategy as dependent on many intertwining factors that are hard to explain. I'd change my description to essentially become more complex.

Next, I look at food, then music, then alcohol, then the duration of the event. If the distance from home is similar with both, I need it to have at least food or music, and not necessarily alcohol. Events that are far away with lots of alcohol and no food are really bad ideas, so I tried to avoid selecting those.
