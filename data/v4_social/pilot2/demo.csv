If I'm going to go to an event with bad socializing, I should at least make it worth my while by eating some food. If distance, socializing and food were all pretty close to one another, I looked at quality of music and alcohol next. If one had better music or more alcohol, that's the one I chose.

I chose 90 minutes over 80 minutes because it just seemed like a round number (an hour and a half) and somehow that appealed to me. I also realize that the amount of alcohol, which is not important to me really, can make a party more fun, in my opinion. So even though I don't drink a lot often, I like to be at a party where that option is there in case I'm feeling YOLO and want to party. It is also good for the other attendees of the party to have access to alcohol, as it can make everyone feel more social and keep things interesting.","I knew that distance was big for me, since I don't like using up a lot of time to get somewhere when I have good food and tv at home. I also knew that socializing was big for me, as that's something I don't have access to at home and isn't that the point of going out? I love eating and food was somewhat a factor.

I'm fine driving to a party if it's going to be a good one and I'm going to see friends who I enjoy spending time with.
The length of the party is where my concern comes in. I have a limited social battery and generally find myself pretty exhausted by the time a long party is over. I'm the type of person who can only stay at a party for about two hours before I need to go home and recharge.
The amount of people at the party is also a small concern. I don't do very well in crowds, so the smaller and more intimate the group, the better.
When I go to a party, my needs are pretty basic. I wouldn't say that I'm a wallflower, but I can enjoy being included in social events and adding my own perspective where it is warranted. I'm comfortable with silence and I don't find it particularly awkward. The social aspect being low doesn't matter much to me as long as there are other distractions.
I like to eat, so having some good food is pretty nice. :)
I don't drink, so access to alcohol has no meaning to me.
The quality of the music doesn't matter much to me. I can assume that I will find some other place during the party to sit and relax without some crazy thumping in my ears.
Basically, you can think of me as a low maintenance person who likes to be with her friends when she has time. I don't have very many needs and I just like spending time with my friends. I like small parties with a few close friends, some decent food, a relaxing atmosphere and not too much time spent outside of the house.","I think that the strategy that most fits my decision choice is strategy E. I do value certain aspects more than others equally and prefer that they all be present in some degree or another. It was very interesting to learn that my thought process could be summed up in a few different strategies. There were others that applied well, but I think this is the best match.","I knew what my section 1 choice process was based on the options I was provided. I deliberated over each aspect of the party, decided on which features were most important to me and then chose based on the amount of these features present at the party.

a) Food available!
