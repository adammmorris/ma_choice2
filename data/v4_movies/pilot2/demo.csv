I like humor, but humor not by itself carrying the movie. I don't care as much about action packed or romantic movies.

I think I probably did leave a few things out the first time around. The section on E and F confused me though, I probably messed that section up. It also took me a minute to understand the last ranking system. 

Basically, I like a variety of movies that are well rounded. I prefer artistic and suspense, I don't care as much for block buster, action packed and violent or romantic. It's difficult because I think if a lot of people like a movie for a lot of different reasons, it's probably a better movie. But I don't always agree with popular choices, so I often felt tugged to try and guess whether or not I'd actually like the movie. I think comedy and humor is important, but I don't know that I care if a movie is funny with nothing else going for it. Sometimes, also, I wanted to switch up what I like because I like variety. So I might choose something more action packed and violent or a comedy a few times. ","I'm not really a logical, reasonable, mathematical person. I'm kind of random and impulsive sometimes. Overall, I tried to guess how much I'd actually want to watch the movie based on the information given. However, it's a really hard way to evaluate which movie is better. I'm sure if I actually watched the movies I'd change my mind on more than a few things. I know what I like in general, but reality is a different beast.
