However if a 700 square foot house had a very good kitchen and AC and was pitted against an alternative with 90 square feet and a ""very bad"" rating for my other criteria, I would probably choose the smaller space. I only did this when the square footage difference was 400 or lower (but I don't think I decided this exact equation until about a third of the way through).

All things being equal, I think I would rather deal with a ""very bad"" AC and a good kitchen than the other way around. Not sure how consistent I was with this metric though.","I don't really understand this question but I'll try...

And being a rental home, one cannot work on this feature themselves, because it wouldn't be our responsibility and we wouldn't gain any ability to keep the AC as we moved on. It is a health and safety issue. Two, I compared to features of where I rent now and where we just bought a home. Square footage-wise at 1,028 can seem cramped, and if rented areas are dysfunctional or non-usable or being worked on, you get much less usable space. The time periods, like a mid-century home, an older home, pretty new in the 2000s, or 60s to 80s were compared as well. I have experiences with all of them, and they greatly influenced my perceptions of what's feasible and also what types of neighborhoods they were in. The information provided on the table also helped me see if this was something I could figure out what the setting was really matching to. Also the yard space and kitchen were directional, because my partner wants to go outside, as well do I. The kitchen is pain or less pain, it would be rare to find a good rented kitchen, I believe, in general. I've only seen one after trying to find a right space to rent in a 11 years of looking. So if it was said as very good, that could really make a difference. It's just one section at least of a house has to be functioning, and the more sections like in the table, the more they can integrate and enhance each other. The one we currently rent is none except location. Landlords do not do anything for people generally, because they have a mass of power. ","I knew, because like taxes, the search for homes and housing is so traumatic that it gets engrained negatively into your being. It has been studied and shown to be likened to the stress of childbirth, say. I knew because I've been through this so much in the last year. You have to have an idea and cannot walk blindly during this process. I also knew the inhumanity of no AC. I mean if you're not able to build shade or systems to modulate for yourself, because someone else has used their position to submit other people into renting, it's really a quality of life reduction and enforcement.

However, when forced, I chose homes in a bad school area if the other two things were below what I want. I can put in an alarm system. If a home is a bit smaller than I would like, I can add onto it.

However, you can't do all that much about being in a better area (with a  better school), unless you send your child to a private school, which is expensive. So that was important to me. Also, you can put in an alarm system, but if the area is bad, it's not super safe for your child to play outside without bringin about possible trouble. I chose home size next, because it's easier to choose something that is large enough, and if that's not possible, you can add an addition to your home.
