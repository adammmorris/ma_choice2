<b>Purpose:</b>

You are invited to take part in a research study designed to look at how people make social judgments and decisions. You are being asked to participate in this study because we are interested in these processes in a wide variety of people. The purpose of this study is to advance our understanding of how individual differences in cognitive functioning contribute to social behavior.

	<p>
<b>Procedures:</b>

If you agree to participate, you will be asked to make judgments or decisions about positive and negative outcomes for yourself and for other people. Afterwards, you will be asked questions related to your reactions to the events, as well as some personality traits and background variables that may affect information processing in these tasks. You may withdraw from this study at any point by closing out of the browser window. Depending on the study, your participation will last between approximately 45 minutes. You will be paid $7.50 an hour for your participation in this study. Although this study will not benefit you personally, we hope that our results will add to the knowledge about how people make decisions about positive and negative outcomes for themselves and for other people.

<b>Risks and Benefits:</b>

There are no known or anticipated risks associated with this study.  Depending  on the study you are participating in, you may be asked to view unpleasant pictures or imagine unpleasant scenarios, but these pictures and scenarios are no worse than what you might see in a news story about a violent event such as a war or a natural disaster. These stimuli may be disturbing to you. If you are participating in this kind of study, it is recommended that you should not complete this study if you suspect that you will be particularly sensitive to or negatively affected by such stimuli. You will be alerted before if you view any such imagery, and you are free to withdraw from the study for any reason at any time.

<b>Confidentiality:</b>

All of your responses will be anonymous. Only the researchers involved in this study and those responsible for research oversight (such as representatives of the Yale University Human Research Protection Program, and the Yale University Human Subjects Committee) will have access to any information that you provide. When we publish any results from this study we will do so in a way that does not identify you. We may also share the data with other researchers so that they can check the accuracy of our conclusions but will only do so if we are confident that your confidentiality is protected.



The researcher will not know your name, and no identifying information will be connected to your survey answers in any way. The survey is therefore anonymous. However, your account is associated with an mTurk number that the researcher has to be able to see in order to pay you, and in some cases these numbers are associated with public profiles which could, in theory, be searched. For this reason, though the researcher will not be looking at anyone’s public profiles, the fact of your participation in the research (as opposed to your actual survey responses) is technically considered “confidential” rather than truly anonymous.
