I feel like that is very important because that isn't something you can change and it says a lot about the people in the neighborhood and who you will be surrounded by in my opinion. I want my family to get the best education to have a bright future. I think that the quality of the kitchen and the quality of AC/heat can always be replaced if it needed to be. The noise population also was a factor but I figured I can get use to it and it wasn't a make or break. As far as traffic I can always plan to leave ahead or avoid the times I know are the worst traffic hours. I of course would like a square foot yard and house to be bigger but the other factors above seemed more important to me. I think transportation and the closeness of parks and restaurants and the year built were more towards the bottom of my choices. ,I answered which ones I thought were most important to the ones I thought were least important. I think some of the features of the home can be fixed so I thought the reputation of the closest school was most important and other features like closeness to the restaurant were less important.

So I chose the two most valuable aspects, which to me were the quality of the heating and air conditioning and the quality of the kitchen. Soon, I had to decide between those two final options and I decided that I could live with anything else as long as I had adequate heating and cooling, so after that point all my answers started to hinge on having superior heating and cooling.
